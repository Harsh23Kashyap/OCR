# OCR Web Application Using Flask and Tesseract


Application:

A web application that lets you extract text from an input image.
The image is extracted using the tesseract optical character recognition engine.
We also provide the results after noise removal using median blur, 
and after morphological operations like erosion followed by dilation, and the user can copy the best option.


This web application allows you to extract text from an input image using the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. It also provides additional features such as noise removal and morphological operations to improve the accuracy of the extracted text.

## Tools Used

- Tesseract: The Tesseract OCR engine is used for extracting text from images. You can find more information about Tesseract [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

- OpenCV: OpenCV is a popular computer vision library used for image processing tasks such as noise removal, morphological operations, etc. You can find more information about OpenCV [here](https://opencv.org/).

- NumPy: NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library in Python that is used for handling multidimensional arrays and performing mathematical operations. You can find more information about NumPy [here](https://numpy.org/).

- Flask: Flask is a lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for handling HTTP requests and building web APIs. You can find more information about Flask [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
